## Contributing

Contributors are always welcome. However, **please file an issue describing what you intend to add before opening a pull request,** *especially* for new features! I have a clear vision of what I want (and do not want) Envy to be, so discussing potential additions might help you avoid duplication and wasted work.

By contributing, you agree to release your changes under the same license as the rest of the project (see below).
